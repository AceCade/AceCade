- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AceCade

I'm a Minecraft addict.
I like to code and play Hypixel Bedwars in my free time.
I'm working on projects such as my own client: Ace Client, Minecraft mods, and texture packs.

When I was younger, around 9-11 years old, I used to make basic Scratch and Roblox games, and stuff like that.
Then I moved onto other languages such as HTML, CSS, Python, ... I also made Minecraft Servers for a while, which either failed,
or were too time- and mentally consuming, so I moved on. And now I'm sitting here learning Java to make some crappy Minecraft Mods and Clients...
